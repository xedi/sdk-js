From time to time, it is permissible to provide user feedback via the runtimes <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console">Console API</ExternalLink>. The primary usecase is to provide detailed error tracking in production or staging environments, and technical feedback in development environments.

To ensure the relevant information is displayed, the `LogManager` provides three methods of outputting to the console:
1. All environments
1. Development environment only
1. Non-development environments

## Configuration

The `LogManager` uses the `mode` configuration value which defaults to `production`. If you are in a development environment set `mode` to `local`.

## Usage

<SourceLink href="https://github.com/xedi/sdk-js/blob/master/src/Logger/LogManager.ts"><InlineCode>LogManager</InlineCode></SourceLink>, <SourceLink href="https://github.com/xedi/sdk-js/blob/master/src/Logger/Logger.ts"><InlineCode>Logger</InlineCode></SourceLink> and <SourceLink href="https://github.com/xedi/sdk-js/blob/master/src/Logger/NullLogger.ts"><InlineCode>NullLogger</InlineCode></SourceLink> all implement the <SourceLink href="https://github.com/xedi/sdk-js/blob/master/src/Interfaces/Logger.ts"><InlineCode>LoggerInterface</InlineCode></SourceLink> which requires implementations of 5 of the Console API's functions:

- `log`
- `error`
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`

These all have the same method signature as the Console API.
```typescript
/**
 * Logger
 */
interface Logger {
    log(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void;
    info(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void;
    debug(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void;
    error(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void;
    warn(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void;
};
```

To output to the console only in a development environment use the `DevelopmentLogger`.

```javascript
this.logger.dev.log(
    'These are not the droids you are looking for',
    droids
);
```

To output to the console only in a non-development environments use the `ProductionLogger`.

```javascript
this.logger.production.log(
    'These are not the droids you are looking for',
    droids
);
```

Finally, to output to the console in all environments use the LogManager.

```javascript
this.logger.log(
    'These are not the droids you are looking for',
    droids
);
```

## Registration

The `LogManager` is registered as `logger` against the application `Container`. It is also exposed statically as `Log`.

```javascript
Xedi.Log.dev.log(
    'These are not the droids you are looking for',
    droids
);
```
