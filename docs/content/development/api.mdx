# Adding API Classes

There are three main stages to adding an API class:

1. Definition
2. Resolution
3. Invocation

## Definition

Within the `src/Services/` directory you should find a number of files. Most notable for us is the `Service.ts` and `Services.ts` files.

<BorderBox mb={2}>
    <GithubIssue issue-id="24" />
</BorderBox>

`Service.ts` is the abstract class from which all our "Service" classes extend. It is responsible for the construction of the class, for handling the <Link to="architecture/events">classes events</Link>, and holding memory references to the <Link to="architecture/configuration">config bag</Link> and the <Link to="architecture/http_requests">HTTP client</Link>.

Within `src/Services` create a new file with the same name as the entity it will host. For example, `Example.ts` should look like this:

```typescript
import Service from  './Service';


/**
 * Example class
 */
class Example extends Service
{
}

export default Example;
```

## Resolution

Remember `src/Services/Services.ts`? This is the first step of building the resolution root for our new class.
`Services.ts` exports a TypeScript namespace, which allows use to easily import all our "Services" into our main class.

Firstly, import your newly created "Service" class.

```diff
diff a/src/Services/Services.ts b/src/Services/Services.ts
 import Accounts from './Accounts';
+import Example from './Example';
```

Then, you should add the imported class to the end of the `export` object.
```diff
diff a/src/Services/Services.ts b/src/Services/Services.ts
     Accounts,
-}
+    Example,
+}
```

Next, you need to register your <Link to="architecture/singletons">singleton</Link>. This will ensure configuration and state persistence.

## Invocation

This is where things start to come together. Locate `src/index.ts` and open it. Inside here, you will find our root object. It is the home of our application container.

The first step here is to register a <Link to="architecture/singletons">singleton</Link> for your "Service" class.
Find the `boot` method, and go to the bottom of that method. Here we are going to add a binding that the container will use to build a single instance of your class.

```typescript
this.singleton(
    'services.example',
    (app: ContainerInterface, config: Config) => {
        return new Services.Example(
            config,
            app.resolve('client')
        );
    }
);
```

The counterpart to this registration is the resolution of its abstract definition; here `'services.example'`.

Near the bottom of the root `Xedi` class, add the following function.

```typescript
static get Example(): Services.Example
{
    return this.resolveInstance()
        .resolve('services.example');
}

```

Congratulations! You can now resolve you new class. If you want, go ahead and jump into the <Link to="tooling/debugging">playground</Link> and type `Xedi.Example`. It should resolve you an instance of your new class and inside, you will find a <Link to="architecture/config">config bag</Link> and a <Link to="architecture/http_requests">HTTP client</Link>.

# Modifying API Classes

You want to start giving your class some abilities. Depending on your situation you might be adding a series of CRUD endpoints, or something entirely different. In most cases, you will be sending HTTP requests to an instance of the XEDI API Gateway. Most endpoints are the same, but there will be a few caveats and edge-cases. Consider the following examples:

```typescript
list() {
    return this.client
        .get<JsonResponse<Example>>(`1/examples`)
        .then((response: AxiosResponse<JsonResponse<Example>>) => {
            return response.data.data;
        });
}
```
<Caption>An indexing method</Caption>

Lets look at line three of the above example. In JavaScript this would look like <InlineCode>.get('1/examples')</InlineCode>, so whats the extra stuff? This how we tell TypeScript, what we expect the <Link to="architecture/http_requests">HTTP Client</Link> to return in the promise. Here we tell it we want a `JsonResponse` which itself, must contain an `Example`.

<Flash varient="info" mb={2}>
<Text fontWeight="bold"><InfoIcon /> What is an <InlineCode>Example</InlineCode>?</Text>

In this instance, Example is a <Link to="development/models">model</Link>. A model is a simple definition of the data structure we expect. If you aren't familiar with this concept, read the section on <Link to="development/models">models</Link>.
</Flash>

On line four, we see that our response expectation is defined again, but this time within an <Link to="architecture/http_requests"><InlineCode>AxiosResponse</InlineCode></Link>. Translated to plain english this reads: <Text as="em">Where <InlineCode>response</InlineCode> is a JSON representation of a Example within an AxiosResponse</Text>. Again, at runtime, this compiles down to nothing, but here in TypeScript it helps us understand the intent of the code.
