import {Flash, Link, BorderBox} from '@primer/components'
import {InfoIcon} from '@primer/styled-octicons'
import {ExternalLink, GithubIssue} from '../../src/components'

## Installation

<Flash mb={2}>
    <InfoIcon ml={1} /> XEDI.js is currently published to the GitHub Package Repository. You can find out more about the GitHub Package Repository <ExternalLink href="https://help.github.com/en/packages">here</ExternalLink>.
    <BorderBox mt={1} bg="white">
        <GithubIssue issue-id="29" />
    </BorderBox>
</Flash>

**Using NPM**

```shell
npm install @xedi/sdk-js
```

XEDI.js also ships with TypeScript typings!

## Configuration

You can configure the SDK using the `Xedi.Config` class. This class extends a JavaScript `Map` object, so the usual `get`, `set`, and `delete` methods will work as per the original object. For example, you can configure which `base_url` should be used to contact a API Gateway instance.

```javascript
Xedi.Config.set('base_url', 'https://api.staging.xedi.com');
```

Below you will find a list of all configurations.

| Configuration | Default Value | Comments |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| `base_url` | `https://api.xedi.com` | |
| `refresh_token` | | Set and managed by `Xedi.Auth` |
| `access_token` | | Set and managed by `Xedi.Auth` |
| `mode` | `production` | |
