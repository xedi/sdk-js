You can configure the SDK using the `Xedi.Config` class. This class extends a JavaScript `Map` object, so the usual `get`, `set`, and `delete` methods will work as per the original object. For example, you can configure which `base_url` should be used to contact a API Gateway instance.

```javascript
Xedi.Config.set('base_url', 'https://api.staging.xedi.com');
```

Below you will find a list of all configurations.

| Configuration | Default Value | Comments |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| `base_url` | `https://api.xedi.com` | |
| `refresh_token` | | Set and managed by `Xedi.Auth` |
| `access_token` | | Set and managed by `Xedi.Auth` |
